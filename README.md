# Planar_Failure

**Basic Information**

The directory provides the raw code (.m and .fig files) which need to be compiled in MatLab in order to become a useful program.

Included in the directory is the actual .exe file (Falling.exe) which when executed opens the program GUI. 
Note that to open the program you must have MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) installed running version 8.0 (R2012b)



**Program Description**

This is a very basic rockfall simulator done in MatLab as a school project. 

The simulator assumes rocks to be point objects and launches them down a pre-defined slope. What has been coded is the projectile algorithm, impact algorithm, and rolling algorithm.

Slope parameters and other input properties are entered into a very basic GUI for the code to execute.

Prior knowledge of rockfall programs and their input parameters is required to oeprate the program. The program follows a basic decision flowchart as shown below.
