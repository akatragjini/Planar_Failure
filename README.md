# Planar_Failure

**Basic Information**

The directory provides the raw code (.m and .fig files) which need to be compiled in MatLab in order to become a useful program.

Included in the directory is the actual .exe file (RPlane.exe) which when executed opens the program GUI. 
Note that to open the program you must have MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) installed running version 8.1 (R2013a)



**Program Description**

This is a very planar failure simulator for rock slopes done in MatLab as a school project. 

The simulator modelels a potentially unstable planar wedge as shown below and calculates the factor of safety.

Slope parameters and other input properties are entered into a very basic GUI for the code to execute.

Prior knowledge of planar failure programs and their input parameters is required to oeprate the program which contains some key functions as shown below to populate results.
The program can handle probabilistic input data and produces several useful plots.
